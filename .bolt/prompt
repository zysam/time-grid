For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.
